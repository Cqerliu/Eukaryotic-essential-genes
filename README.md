# Eukaryotic-essential-genes
A graph-based semi-supervised approach for predicting eukaryotic essential genes

In the PY folder, we give the row code for performing essential gene prediction based on LGC method, and the code for calculating features.

There are also some features that are analyzed using online analysis tools. In the Other folder, we give the corresponding links of these tools.

In the Data folder, we give the derived data(the labels and features of the genes) .
